GeminiApp - Interactive Math Problem Solver
GeminiApp is a React Native application designed to offer interactive, real-time solutions to math problems using the Google Gemini API. This project has a built-in refresh system and follows a clean, modular approach for better maintainability. The development environment is set up with Expo, so you can easily start working with the app by following the simple steps below.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before starting the development server, ensure you have the following tools installed:

Node.js (v14 or later)
Expo CLI (if not using npx)
Yarn (optional, for package management)
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/itscodercamp/GeminiApp.git
cd GeminiApp
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
or, if you're using Yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
expo start
Alternatively, you can use:

bash
Copy code
npx expo start
or

bash
Copy code
yarn start
Use the refresh system to see real-time updates as you make changes.

Integrating the Google Gemini API
This app utilizes Google Gemini's API to process math problems and provide interactive solutions. To get started with the API, follow these steps:

Visit Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project (if you haven't already).
Enable the Gemini API for your project.
Generate an API key from the APIs & Services > Credentials section.
Add your API key to the project:
Open the project in your editor.
Locate the config.js or appropriate environment file.
Paste your API key:
javascript
Copy code
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY';
Building APK for Android
To build an APK for Android, use the following EAS (Expo Application Services) commands:

Install the Expo EAS CLI:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g eas-cli
Log in to your Expo account:

bash
Copy code
eas login
Configure your project for EAS builds:

bash
Copy code
eas build:configure
Build the APK:

bash
Copy code
eas build -p android --profile production
After the build completes, you'll receive a link to download your APK.

Conclusion
This is a basic project but incorporates some great approaches in React Native app development. It provides a simple but effective solution using the Google Gemini API, making it a practical starting point for more advanced applications.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and use it as the foundation for more interactive and dynamic projects.
